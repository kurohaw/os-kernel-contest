//! # Axfs-ng VFS (Virtual File System)
//!
//! This crate provides a virtual file system abstraction layer for the Axfs-ng filesystem.
//! It offers a unified interface for working with different filesystem implementations
//! through mountpoints, locations, and file/directory operations.
//!
//! ## Main Components
//!
//! - **Filesystem**: Core filesystem abstraction
//! - **Mountpoint**: Mount points for filesystem hierarchies
//! - **Location**: Represents a location within the filesystem tree
//! - **DirEntry**: Directory entries (files and directories)
//! - **Path utilities**: Path manipulation and normalization
//! - **Types**: Common data types for metadata, permissions, etc.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `no_std` compatible
//! - Mount/unmount operations
//! - File and directory operations
//! - Path resolution and normalization
//! - Metadata management
//! - Cross-platform filesystem abstraction
